Thank you for reviewing my code for the Fetch Backend Engineer Excercise.
The following are steps to run the transactionHandler program:
1. Compile the transactionHandler and transaction java files:
    javac transactionHandler.java transaction.java
2. Then choose the points to be spend and identify file name/location of the CSV file:
    ex. points: 5000, file: transactions.csv
3. Then run the transactionHandler.java file followed by points to spend and the file name:
    java transactionHandler 5000 transactions.csv
